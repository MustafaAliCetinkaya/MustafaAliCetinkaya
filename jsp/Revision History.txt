	================
	TO DO: Build.java -- remove Build.java alpha notices
	
	3/17/10		-rnj
				Implemented Path interface for SamplerCurves, 
				and wrote PointOnSamplerCurveAnim, so we can animate along them, fixing
				BZ68. JSP: Animate point on Point Locus or Function Plot produces java exception.
	
	
	*** 11/2009	RELEASE AS JSP 5.00 coordinating with GSP 5.00
	
	9/9/08		-rnj
				Removed support for provisional 'Derivative' command (introduced
				in <g2> 5/1/05), since its format (identical to 'Function') is
				inappropriate for the imagined-future-JSP that can automatically
				re-differentiate symbolic derivatives from the functions that they
				differentiate.
	
	7/31/08		- rnj
				Added support for 
				
				dashed, dotted, solid - line styles
				
				Separately, consolidated various redundant isHit implementations
				from Draggable gPoint subclasses into the superclass.
				
	7/24/08		- rnj
				Added support for
				
				hairline, thin, mediumLine, thick(*) - line styles
				dot, small, mediumPoint, large - point styles
				
				"medium" style, which sets both mediumLine and mediumPoint styles
				
				(*) Since "thick" had different semantics under g1, "thick"
				is only interpreted as "thicker than mediumLine" if your applet
				specifies MinGrammarVersion=2 (or higher) as a parameter.
				
	
	7/11/08		- rnj
				Added (requests for) anti-aliasing to graphics contexts, leading to improved
				appearance in most browsers. Also began switch to Graphics2D, for better
				rendering appearance. Done so far: points, straights, circles, point loci,
				straight loci. 
	
	6/22/05		- mrj & rm
				Renamed output to "jsp5_dev.jar", and abandoned class-folder output. By retargetting
				GSP export to a new applet name, we prevent v2-grammar HTML files from inadvertently
				being used with v1 (jsp4.jar) applets. From v2 (and jsp5.jar) and later, we have a new
				mechanism for protecting future growth (MinGrammarVersion, see 2/01/03). The "_dev" is
				simply to indicate that v2 is currently in development and should be sandboxed; once
				V2 is believed final we will switch to jsp5.jar (before release of GSP5).
	
	6/21/05		- rnj
				Implemented <g2> PlotFixedXY(coordSys, xCoordConstant, yCoordConstant); [TT#3043].
	
	5/1/05		- mrj
				At Matt's suggestion, including in <g2> "Derivative". It has the same grammar as a Function
				("Derivative(xcor, ycor, prefix string, calculation string)(parents);"), and is mapped by Sketch.java
				to a Function object. This is for possible future extensions, e.g. if we ever make Functions
				editable in JavaSketchpad, Derivative will need to be marked as different than Function on export.
	
	12/10/04	- mrj
				More work on a <g2> grammar for TT#2920. Function Plots are now implemented.
				Grammar: FunctionPlot(function, coord sys, number of samples, domain start, domain end, projection)
				where projection can be 0 (y = f(x)), 1 (x = f(y)), 2 (r = f(theta)), or 3 (theta = f(r)).
				Example: FunctionPlot(37,6,200,-10,10,0);
				
				Additionally, "Point on object(objRef, number)" can now have either a FunctionPlot or a PointLocus
				as its parent. In either case, the number argument specifies the relative location of the 
				point along the parent -- the decimal fraction of the way through the parental domain that the 
				point should be located.
				
				Added testfile.html and adjusted build configuration (.xcode file) so that interactive
				debugging is possible. Replace the construction parameter (and only the construction 
				parameter) of the testfile.html applet to run a certain construction under 
				the debugger.
				
				Clicking on the About box now includes the URL of the applet appended to the URL
				of the page to open.
	
	10/25/04 - mrj
				Builds under XCode, and project has been divided such that every class is in
				a separate file. Also, new file build.java: the build number and relevant
				strings are now in their own file, rather than class variables of Sketch.java. [TT#2914]
				
				Functions are now implemented, with a <g2> grammar [1st half of TT#2920].
				Grammar: Function(xcor, ycor, prefix string, calculation string)(parents);
				In the calculation string of a Function, use 'x' for all occurances of the 
				independent variable.
				Use: Calculate(xcor, ycor, prefix string, calculation string)(parents);
				Changed calculation string: now accepts user-defined functions: @f{A-Z}.
				Example: Calculate(15, 15, 'f(3) = ', '3 @fA')(2); //2 is a Function
				Also, calculation strings are now allowed to have an empty parent list.
	
	10/6/04 - mrj
				New feature for build 0652 and later: the applet's build number is displayed
				in the lower left hand corner. Use the applet-wide parameter "ShowBuildNumber"
				to specify: 0 or no parameter means no build number shown, 1 means build
				number displayed. [TT#2906]
	
	8/17/04 - rnj
				Rewrote Move buttons to avoid reliance on a fixed movement vector that could
				become obsolete under changing geometry. New API (an extension of Draggable
				interface) is amenable for path-specific subclassing if we want to eventually
				add GSP4-style path-navigation intelligence.
				
				Refactored FreePoint and DriverPoint to share a common base class, MouseFreePoint
				primarily for code sharing.
				
	
	8/11/04 - MRJ		
				
				Implemented angle bisector and defined <g2> grammar for it [TT#2616].
				
				Defined a new parameter, <PARAM NAME=PixelsPerLengthUnit VALUE={integer}>, which 
				indicates the scaling factor to use in showing measurements as approximately in 
				inches or centimeters rather than always in pixels. Eventually this will be
				exported from GSP's Advanced Preferences | System | Screen Resolution field; for now,
				it needs to be hand specified [TT#2593]. This should be documented in <g2>, but is
				grammar-neutral in the sense that <g1>-JSP won't crash if there's an applet PARAM
				it doesn't recognize. 
				
				Implemented the ability to decide, either on a sketch level with a parameter, or on a
				measurement or calculation level with an argument (or both), how many digits of precision
				past the decimal point should be displayed [TT#2862]. Document in <g2> but note that
				<g1> won't crash.
				
				Implemented and defined <g2> grammar for ToggleVisibilityButtons, which can both show and
				hide objects (and change their labels accordingly) [TT#2125]. 
				
				Added a build number, which should be kept in sync with the desktop Sketchpad build number.
	
	
	DO Fix JSP export of dimensioned constants!  What's wrong with TinLissy, for instance--it spits out 360 deg, when we really want 2Pi radians. Or is it that our plotted rotations should be interpreting their args in degrees (more likely)?
	ADD TextColor attribute?
	
	2/01/03		Implemented colorization as a type of Transformer, and convinced loci to archive
				colors of individual samples if their traceGObj was colorized. Defined grammar <in g2>
				and constructions for Spectrum and Intensity univariate colorations and RGB and HSV 
				trivariate colorations, corresponding to GSP 4.0's color options.  
				
				Fixed a problem in which intersections of lines could behave extremely poorly,
				numerically, when the second of the two lines was near vertical. [TT#2557]
				
				Defined a new parameter, <PARAM NAME=MinGrammarVersion VALUE={integer}>, which indicates
				the MINIMUM version of the JSP grammar that legally describes the contents of an
				CONSTRUCTION parameter. This in turn implies the minimum version of the JSP applet
				capable of parsing that CONSTRUCTION. Added code at Sketch startup that verifies
				the present applet understands a grammar at least equal to the MinGrammarVersion.
				If not, the applet refuses to parse the construction (which would error, since we
				don't understand its grammar), and instead displays an applet-window error message.
				The contents of this error message can be specified in the HTML file itself as
				the value of a new parameter (NAME=GrammarVersionError); if that parameter is not
				present, a generic error ("You must update this JSP &c.") is used instead.
				
				Rewrote Sketch class parser error handler to throw exceptions containing human-readable
				error messages rather than to print errors to System.console. Modified GSP applet
				to field thrown errors from sketch and display them directly in the applet window.
	
	11/08/02	Extended gCircle:CircleCenterAndRadius:Constrain() to recognize that parent2
				(the radius specifier) may be a (length) Value rather than a Segment. This
				fixes TT#2480. 
	
	10/28/02	Replaced GObject.descendsFrom() implementation with one which limits recursion both for
				negative and positive searches, rather than for negative searches only.  This dramatically
				increases the effectiveness of this search when looking for ancestors of children located deep in
				the object list but with relatively few ancestors. [TT#2492]
				
				Revised version# printed to console command line at applet launch.
	
	[released as 4.00 with no official grammar version number but, informally, grammar#1 <g1>]
	
	6/11/01		mdl - added CoordSysByAxes, RectangularUnitPoint
	
				UnitPoint now an abstract base class of SimpleUnitPoint (old unit point), and
				RectangularUnitPoint (new). Unit points, Axis now support getUnitLengthX() and
				getUnitLengthY() methods for rectangular axes support.
	
	6/11/01		rnj & ml - fixed problem where dragged unit points snapped back to their
				original scale when dragging their origin. Also defined better UnitPoint()
				semantics, and changed "Axis" to "Axis3" for backsupporting GSP/3 sketches
				[UPDATE GRAMMAR!] and introduced "Axis4," which is defined rather than
				by a coordSys (Axis3), instead by an origin and unit point (as per GSP4).
				Also added "SquareUnitPoint," expecting coordSysByAxes and RectangularUnitPoint()
				to follow.
				
	
	6/9/01		rnj - Revised copyright notice to 2001, and switched release to JSPDR3.5++ as
				we anticipate frequent development up until release of GSP/4.00 (at which point we
				should rev the applet to JSP_R400, or some such).
	
	11/1/00		Released as JSPDR3.5, locally only, because the Converter has not yet been updated.
	
	10/4/00		Added
					Rotate/MeasuredAngle(preimage, center, measuredAngle);
					
	7/3/00		Added
					ConcatText(x, y)(t1, t2, ..., tn);
					
					which concatenates text objects t1..tn and places them at (x, y).
					
	6/19/00		Added
					bold
					italic
					plain
					size(xx)
					font('yy')
				
				formatting tags, which apply to any text object. These override the
				default font for said text objects. Thus "plain" should appear as the
				first format to override a default. For instance, if actionFont is
				ITALIC, and you want it to be BOLD NON-ITALIC, use [plain, bold] for
				the format specifier. The [plain] overrides the ITALIC of the default
				actionFont; the [bold] then re-adds bold formatting to the specifier.
	
				Added
					justifyRight
					justifyLeft
					justifyCenter
					
				formatting tags, which apply to any text object.
				
				Added
					PegText(pointParent, textParent);
				
				which creates a copy of textParent whose fundamental position (pre-justification)
				is located at pointParent's coordinates.
				
				Added
					FixedText(x, y, message);
					
				which creates text which does not change at x, y (pre-justification). 
				
	6/16/00		Added
					SimultaneousButton(x, y, title)(but1, but2, ..., butn);
					
				which causes but1 - butn button parents to be pressed simultaneously.
				
				Added [image('url')] formatting attribute to buttons. Specifying
				an (optional) image causes the button's appearance to be dictated
				by the image, rather than by its string name.
				
	11/20/99	Sent to ESCOT as 3.4 for Chris DiGiano's wandering llama.
	
	11/20/99	Added support for points on polygons (use Point on object(xxx, offset)) where
				xxx = thePolygon and offset = originalVertex + edgeLength.
				
				Added support for "layer(x)" formatting tag, which allows you to manually
				control the drawing order of objects within their layer. Use positive numbers,
				where higher values appear on top of lower values. Values don't have to be
				consecutive, but if you specify values greater than 1000, you may move into
				the next higher layer of objects.
	
	11/19/99	Added
					ImageOnPoint(point, imageURL);
					ImageBetweenPoints(point, imageURL);

	7/16/99		Factored event handling out of the core Sketch() class, which now implements event-model
				neutral event handlers and derives from a caller-provided class, SketchpadRuntimePanel,
				that implements the caller's preferred event handler (forwarding received events on to
				the Sketch()'s model-neutral handlers).
				
	7/9/99		Added support for DiagnosticLevel parameter, which controls statusLine and debugging info.
				Switched back to 1.1 event model for escot beans.
				Added a new target, SketchpadBase.jar, for distributing inner classes under ESCOT volunteer license.
	
	3/26/99		Posted to site for controlling the SRC applets, but did not bundle as
			    a newly-available download. I believe I fixed some of MRJ 2.1's inconsistencies
			    by turning system.out.println()'s into system.out.print(...+"\r\n")'s, but
			    I still get stray "verifyErrors" at runtime on arbitrary classes which have not
			    been touched since working fine. Currently, Axis() always fails---try nucalc.html.
			    Goal is to wait until Pro5 ships, and see if it's finalized Java tools fix my problems.
	
	3/9/99		Fixed problem where applet failed to redraw properly on startup
				Avoided deadlock if sketch.paint() threw
	
	11/9/98		Fixed FixedAngleMarkedDistance, MeasuredAngleFixDistance, MarkedAngleMarkedDistance, for correct vertical displacements.
	
	
	RELEASED DR3 - End of June 1998
	
	6/18/98		Reverted to Java 1.0 Event Model for Netscape 4.0/Mac compatibility---damn them!
				Shortened a few classnames so it works on a Mac (with limited filename lengths) with browsers
				that don't understand ARCHIVEs---damn them!
	
	6/15/98		Improved speed of sketches containing multiple loci tremendously.
	
	6/8/98		Implemented Dilation/MarkedRatio
	
				Added DriverPoint(measureX, measureY, initialX, initialY);
	
	6/2/98		Added a JSP_ExternIO getExternIOItemList() method, which returns a list of the
				GObjects in a sketch that can be directly addressed by a given JSP_ExternIO
				interprocess communication protocol.
				
				Added Parameter measurements which can be set by external callers.
	
	5/24/98		Implemented loci of gStraights
	
	5/23/98		Fixed a bug that caused some versions of Internet Explorer to crash on a
				bad cast while loading sketches. Specifically, old code used the same
				routine to read ints as doubles from the paramLine, and some grammar-spec
				parentIndices, when moved from char to double to int, experienced sufficient
				precision loss to wind up referencing the wrong parent!
	
	4/17/98		Made analytically-specified vastly more efficient by suppressing updates in 
				measurement text during locus resampling.
				
				Implemented Dilation/SegmentRatio
	
	4/16/98		Updated to new (Java 1.1) awt event model
	
				Changed # of significant digits on displayed measurements from max to 3.
	
	4/14/98		Added separate Bean development project as a target of the master JavaSketchpad.µ
				Codewarrior project. Removed "applet wrapper" from Bean, and replaced former Applet
				services to the Sketch (which were stubbed out at the Bean level) with a separate,
				JavaSketchpad-specific interface, SketchpadRuntimeServices, which allows a Sketch
				object to be embedded in an arbitrary runtime context.
	
	2/11/98		Implemented Translation/MarkedAngle/MarkedDistance 
				Implemented Translation/MarkedAngle/FixedDistance
	
	2/10/98		Added PolarTranslation to the grammar (was implemented but undocumented in DR2).
				Fixed grammar for Perpendicular, Parallel, Intersect1, Intersect2, and Ray, all
				of which had reversed parameter lists.
				
				Fixed reversal of coordinate system ("up" corresponded to negative values for y)
	
	2/10/98 rnj Added IAC support (JSP_ExternIO) and developed some sample remote applets that
			    communicate with current code (DR2.2a).

	2/6/98 rnj	Posted JSP DR2.1, containing below fix (for AMTE JavaSketchpad workshop)
			    as well as Scott's latest WinExporter, which fixed a WinNT error message
			    about missing .DLLs.
	
	1/29/98 rnj	Updated to Codewarrior Pro 2.1, Java 1.1.
				
				Implemented transformed circle interiors. This now eliminates the bug
				in which images of circle interiors were circles.
			
		
	----------DR2 RELEASE: 9/20/97---------

	9/20/97	rnj	- Changed about box to point to jsp_about.html.
	
	9/17/97 rnj	- Added 'r'/'R' as a synonym for reset

				  Fixed a bug in which the about box button text was not always displayed in
				  a consistent font.
				  
				  Added support for a space token delimiter in compoundExprs, allowing
				  '1 3 +' to be interpreted as 'one plus three' instead of as 'thirteen plus'.
				  
				  Added support for converting double apostrophes ('') into single 
				  apostrophes when they're embedded in apostrophe-delimited strings
				
	9/10/97	rnj	- Reversed the interpretation of movement pairs (they're now dest, source) for 
				  compatibility with desktop Sketch format.
				  
				  Eliminated bug in which traced points traced their label as well.
				  
				  Fixed a bug in which loci's initial appearance (first frame) was incorrect.
				  
				  Added X+Y axis objects (KLOOGE: still needs custom DrawVisible() routine)
				  
				  Added Unit Points.
	
	9/9/97	rnj	- Added tan() func to compound measurements for desktop-compatibility,
				  and restructured things so there's a single equFormComponent space
				  instead of a separate one for each derived multimeasure. This allows
				  easier conversion from desktop Sketchpad (in which there is only
				  one enumeration of all equFormComponents).
				  
				  Added PlotXY() primitive.
	
	9/8/97	rnj	- Added initial loci, with circle & segment paths.
	
	9/5/97	rnj	- Added Ratio/Points to Measurements.
				  Added tracing.
				  Added "DirectedAngles" parameter, default 1, to control signage of angles.
	
	9/4/97	rnj	- Defined coordinate systems (and Origin/Unit + UnitCircle specs), with
				  thick or thin grids, defined multimeasure framework and
				  simple (x, y) coordinate measurements.
				- Added support for Translation/FixedAngle/MarkedDistance
				
	9/3/97	rnj	- Deferred graphics initialization until the applet is known to be
				  initialized (i. e. in start() context instead of during init()). This
				  fixes some problems evident in Internet Explorer 3.0/Win.
				- Added radius, circumference, perimeter, ratio/segments, area, slope,
				  and distance measurements.
				- Put into place basic framework for calculations (parse + evaluator).
				  Current grammar requires expression compilation (into RPN) to be
				  performed by the user, rather than the applet, but supports the
				  arithmetic + predef functions of desktop JSP--the only compatibility
				  lacking is for equFormComponent-extraction, which has to wait until
				  we have multimeasures.
				
	9/2/97	rnj	- Added a status display to the applet during parseGObjs().
				- Turned off animating threads when the applet is stopped, requeued them when
				  restarted. The implementation here incidentally removes the restriction on
				  5 auto-start action buttons: the sky's the limit, now!
				- Implemented a simple "about box" paradigm: hitting '?' when the applet is
				  active launches the jsp home page, or clicking in the lower-right corner.
	
				  
	9/1/97	rnj - FIRST E-MAIL NOTICE OF INTERNAL RELEASE DESCRIBED WORK TO DATE:
	
				- Removed mouse-dragging from yesterday's automatic updater to increase
				  responsiveness to drags. The trick is to use Paint() instead of Repaint()
				  if you have to redraw the screen during multi-threading, because the awt's
				  screen update thread (which repaint() tickles) is lower-priority than any
				  sketch-based thread.
				  
				- Added support for Label, Action, and Measure family of font parameters (e. g.
				  LabelFont = "TimesRoman", ActionSize = 12, MeasureBold = 1, MeasureItalic = 0.)
				  This allows users to override Sketchpad's defaults for text styles.
				  
				- Fixed a bug in which changing a sketch's speed zapped "instant" movement buttons.
				
				- Added support for BackRed, BackBlue, and BackGreen background color parameters
				  (range is 0-255 for each; default is (200, 200, 200)).
				  
				- Added support for "auto" formatting parameter for action buttons. Up to 5
				  buttons may have this format in a sketch. Any button with this format will
				  be automatically "clicked" the moment the applet begins. You can auto-click
				  a hidden button to cause its action (e. g. an animation) to occur without
				  presenting the button control to the user (because it's hidden).
				  
				- Added basic framework for simple measurements, of which Angle and Length
				  are implemented. Added a formatting attribute, suffix(str), which sets str as
				  the (optional) suffix of a measurement. Added an applet parameter, 
				  MeasureInDegrees, which if 1 will result in measurements being reported in
				  degrees (default = 0; radians). All angle measurements are currently directed.
	
	8/31/97 rnj	- Rewrote drawing and g-object updating to avoid race conditions when multiple
				  threads are updating both the GObjectList and the screen simultaneously. Now,
				  the screen updating rate is constant regardless of how many separate threads
				  are updating the GObjectPool.  Tasks that affect the object pool should call
				  GObjectsLock()'s mutex lock; tasks that require continuous screen updating
				  should request it of the sketch (through AddContinuousScreenUpdateProcess)
				  rather than directly from the AWT (through repaint()).
				  
	8/30/97	rnj	- Added generic support for animation buttons, which must be subclassed
				  for specific paths. Implemented circular paths.
				  
				  Added global speed control: < and > slow up and speed down animations and movements.
				  (Check that this works for movement!)
				  
				  Also implement gStraight paths, although currently JSP always assumes animation
				  on gStraights is animation on the segment between gStraight endpoints. (This is
				  true, for segments!) 
	
	8/29/97	rnj	- Added support for labels, which are always in the same font.
				  New applet parameters include LabelFont (default: Helvetica), LabelSize (default: 12),
				  and LabelBold (default 0) and LabelItalic (default 0).
				  
				  Labels are specified by a label(xxx) formatting parameter. Currently only point labels
				  are drawn.
				  
				  Added support for movement buttons, which are specified by a compound-constructor as follows
				  
				  MoveAction ({numeric1}, {numeric2}, {numeric3}, {string}) ({obj1a, obj1b, obj2a, obj2b ... objNb, objNb)
				  
				  The movement button's upper left coordinate is located at ({n1}, {n2}) in the coordinate plane.
				  The movements limited speed is specified by {numeric3}, in pixels per frame. This is
				  the speed that the slowest moving point in the action will travel. A speed of zero means that all
				  moving points should travel to their destinations instantly.
				  
				  The movement button's label is specified by {string}.
				
				  The secondary argument list contains N pairs of point references (1...N), where N>1.
				  Each pair of point references (a and b) indicate first the free point to move, and
				  second, the destination of that free point.
				  
				  Added Show and Hide actions. 
				  
				  ShowButton ({x}, {y}, {string}) ({obj1}, {obj2}, ... {objN})
				  
	8/28/97	rnj	- Rewrote BAP-equivalent to avoid redundant recursions. 
	
				- Rewrote string parser to avoid overscanning string contents when parsing construction:
				  huge speed up!
				  
				- Added clipping of intersections between gStraights that weren't both lines.
	
	8/27/97	rnj	- Fixed a bug in Rotate/MarkedAngle in which all angles were reversed.
				  Switched to JAR-archive distribution (n. b. this will require a change
				  in desktop GSP-exported HTML.)
	
	2/14/97	rnj	- Implemented optional custom color format (form: "color(r, g, b)" where
				  r, g, and b are all ints between 0-255). Here is the note for the
				  eventual grammar doc:

* BEGIN QUOTE *
You may also assign an arbitrary color using a format specifier of the form

color({red}, {green}, {blue})

where {red}, {green}, and {blue} are {numericConstants} between 0 and
255 specifying in total a color within a RGB color cube. Thus

[color(0, 0, 0)]

is a synonym of "[black]", and 

[color(255, 255, 255)]

is a synonym of "[white]".
* END QUOTE *

				  
	2/13/97	rnj	- Implemented DILm3R_C. (This is already described in the DR1 grammar,
				  though it wasn't implemented for the DR1 release.)
	
	------ DR1 Release --------
	
	2/6/97	rnj - Removed AlphaNotices in favor of simpler console-based alpha notice;
				  released DR1.
				  
	2/3/97	rnj - Implemented ROTm3A_C and DR1 AlphaNotices
	
	1/21/97	rnj	- Added support for gImages specified by URL. Syntax is:
							Image(<x-double>,<y-double>, <url-string>);				
					e.g.
							Image (0, 0, 'nickj.gif'); 
	
	9/18/96	rnj	- Fixed some bugs affecting rays and parallel lines. 
	
				- Implemented basic transformation architecture, and defined
				  handlers for REFLECT_C, DILfR_C, ROTfA_C, TRANSfXfY_C,
				  TRANSfAfD_C, and TRANSV_C.
	
	9/17/96	rnj	Switched JavaGSPspec parent references from label strings (which are not 
				inherently unique and which are computational intensive to parse) to an
				implicitly-indexed numeric reference.
				
				- Added comments to JavaGSPspec.
				- Added linear, line/circle, and circle/circle intersections.
				- Added CircleByCenter&Radius.
				
			
	9/6/96	rnj	Reduced startup speed by 60% and eliminated bugs related to "shortened"
				lines and rays when multiple JavaSketches appear in one context (e. g.
				a web page) with different sized panels.
	
	9/5/96	rnj	Implemented points on circles.
	
	9/2/96	rnj	Implemented circle interiors, points on gStraights, and parallel
				and perpendicular line constructors.
				
	8/30/96	rnj	Replaced manually-specified DragDependencies with (inefficiently)
				calculated ones. Most GObjs still only track parents and not
				children, but after assembling the construction, we percolate up
				from all GObjs() to their draggable ancestors to statically
				compute dependency lists for the drag ancestors. Drag.java unit
				isolates most of this, though Sketch.InitObjects() becomes
				responsible for making a few calls during sketch startup post-
				processing.
				
	8/27/96	rnj	Completed v1.0 of Least Squares dedicated applet. Archived as
				"Least Squares 8/27/96" and released internally to DataSpace group.
