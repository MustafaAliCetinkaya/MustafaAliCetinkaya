Ideas for Java Sketchpad:

PROMISES FOR DR4.X

3/1/02:	Added Eugenio to field test list

		(For Eugenio) Add "Bisector(A, B, C)"
		
		Add Kunkel to field test list
		
PROMISES FOR DR3: (Michael Rundel e8826247@student.tuwien.ac.at)
	Nick promised he'd look into adding coordinates-of-cursor to the browser status bar
	Nick promised he'd look into "lifting the applet" into a separate window
	
- Implement abstract GObject.PostDragUpdate(), and define GObject.InstantiateGeometry, which first Constrains()
and then PostDragUpdates().

TO DO:
- ParseConstruction: Move all fileOpen stuff into its own class.
- Implement (default) Info + Reset buttons, w/params to override their presence (and in info's case, content)
- Peg circle/circle intersections to integer plane (someday)
- Implement double precision vertices for gPolygon and its subclasses; convert iVertex[] to PRIVATE drawVertex[]

DONE:
[2/1/2003] Parameter: RequiresApplet=(rev#). {Default=0} If the current rev of the applet is less than this parameter,
the applet refuses to show any of the sketch, and reverts to the same error state that it
produces if it encounters a .JSP with unrecognized, non-optional content.

[2/1/2003] ParseConstruction: Implement error catching w/throw.
