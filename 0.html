                <h4>(Doing geometry is learning geometry.)</h4>

                Nowadays, Turkish Education System is moving in new directions. Currently, in many classrooms, it is rare for a lesson to be taught to rows of children studiously bent over worksheets, practicing computations, rules, and formulas. Instead, it is more common (I think it will more common) to observe children engaging in a whole-class discussion about what they have discovered, what has been learned. In other words, they construct their own knowledge. Namely, they do geometry instead of dealing with only rules and formulas. They are actively involved in a wide variety of physical and mental actions such as exploring, investigating, patterning, modeling, and verifying.

                <br><br>I designed this site to help students for a much greater depth of understanding of constructions. They will get idea about constructing geometry by using only a compass and straight edge.

                <br><br>Constructions: The drawing of various shapes using only a compass a straightedge. No measurement of lengths or angles is allowed.

                <br>The word construction in geometry has a very specific meaning: "Drawing of geometric items such as lines and circles using only a compass and straightedge". Very importantly, you are not allowed to measure angles with a protractor or measure lengths with a ruler.

                <br><br>Geogebra will facilitate their learning process, and they will learn more about the constructions by following the Step-by-step Instructions. The example shown below may give some idea about what I mean.
                <h5>Step by Step Instructions</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mark a point R that will be one endpoint of the new line
                        segment.
                    </li>
                    <li>Set the compass point on the point P of the line segment to
                        be copied.
                    </li>
                    <li>Adjust the compass width to the point Q. The compass width
                        is now equal to the length of the line segment PQ.
                    </li>
                    <li>Without changing the compass width, place the compass point
                        on the point R on the line you drew in step-1.
                    </li>
                    <li>Without changing the compass width, draw an arc roughly
                        where the other endpoint will be.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pick a point on the circle that will be the other endpoint
                        of the new line segment.
                    </li>
                    <li>Draw a line between points.</li>
                    <li>Done. The new line segment is equal in length (congruent
                        to) the line segment |PQ|.
                    </li>
                </ol>
